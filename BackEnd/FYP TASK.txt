1) Medical (inpatient/outpatient)
- For analysis, we need to know how many inpatient and outpatient cases for medical team

Linda: You can refer to the excel data sheet I sent, if the field 'hospital admitted' is not empty, it means they are inpatient cases. If it is empty, then it is most likely a outpatient case, how we do it normally is extract into an excel file and filter that field.
