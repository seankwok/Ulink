1) Since you recently clean up your codes and put in folders, do we have to edit our URL thats calling ur method?
2) For ranking.html, the "DisplayDoctorBySpecialty" we pass you 3 things(specialty, startdate,enddate), so u need return doctors with such specialty based on # of engagament based on the dates
